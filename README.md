# Mozilla-Thunderbird
Can anyone help me to figure out why the Mozilla Thunderbird e-mail program keeps freezing in windows 10
none of the public help forums have received answers for this problem, one person suggested disabling windows search but that is already disabled and the problem still happens. Its most frustrating.
